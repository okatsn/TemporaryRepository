# My Research Topics

## Stochastic Dynamics and Informational Analysis of Earthquake Rupture Processes

- Developed and applied stochastic models using the <span class="fragment highlight-current-bold" fragment-index=1>Langevin equation</span> ^[Essentially a kind of stochastic differential equation (SDE) that describes the evolution of a system under both deterministic and random forces.] and <span class="fragment highlight-current-bold" fragment-index=2>Fokker-Planck equation</span> ^[A kind of partial differential equation (PDE) governing the time evolution of the probability density function of a stochastic variable, that shares a similar diffusion-like form with the Shallow-Ice Approximation (SIA) equation, but describes the evolution of probability densities of rupture momentum rather than ice thickness.] to analyze earthquake rupture processes, providing insights into earthquake dynamics and physics-based explanation for empirical scaling laws.
- Utilized the informational theory ^[Fisher-Shannon analysis] approaches to distinguish between different frictional regimes based on both synthetic and experimental data, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of earthquake process.

### The equivalent Fokker-Planck equation

::::{.columns}::::
:::{.column width='40%'}
##### Langevin equation

- Straightforward physics reasoning
- Rupture processes realized as "sample paths"

##### Fokker-Planck equation

- Describe the same process from the perspective of "probability density"

$$
        \frac{\partial P(v,t)}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial}{\partial v} \Bigg( \left(  - F_C \frac{v(t)}{|v(t)|} + F_\text{ext}  \right) P(v,t) \Bigg) \\
